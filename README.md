# No Starch Press Product Sorter
A simple, unfinished command-line tool that scrapes No Starch Press' web store and sorts their products.

## Why?
No Starch Press' storefront doesn't provide sorting functionalities. While a "New" area exists, it doesn't sort all of their titles by date. And while a lot of classical texts have withstood the test of time, I like to browse some publisher's offerings by publication date, so I can observe past and present publishing trends.

## To-Do
- Sort the products by date.
- Add a clean command-line interface with some varied options.
- Add ability to cache the extracted information locally, most likely in the JSON format, to lessen requests made to No Starch Press' website.
  - This comes with a possible sub-task: a command-line option to manually refresh the cached data.
